# Image-Encryption-using-AES-and-DNA-Cryptography
Due to increase in use of images in various fields, it is very important to protect the confidential image data from unauthorized access and availability to strangers.It uses the AES and DNA algorithm.The nucleotides that make these polymers are named after the nitrogen base like ACGT Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine. Main aim of using this is because of its speed, less storage, minimal power requirements and high security in combination of bases.
